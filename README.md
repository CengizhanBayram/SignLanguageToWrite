# SignLanguageToWrite
## Project Description
This project includes an application that aims to detect the sign language of sign language users and translate this sign language into text. It was developed using libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow.

# Requirements
The following requirements are needed to run the project:

Python 3.11: The project is compatible with Python 3.11 versions.
OpenCV: OpenCV library must be installed for image processing. 
TensorFlow: TensorFlow is required to run the deep learning model. 
Switch on your camera:
The application will use your camera to recognise sign language. The camera window will open automatically.

# Observe Sign Language Translation:
Follow the sign language in the image taken by the camera and observe the translation results of the application.
